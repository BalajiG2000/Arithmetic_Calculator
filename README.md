# Arithmetic_Calculator
This C++ project needs all the three programs to be executed for functioning. I have made this in repl.it{https://repl.it/}  ,which is an online compiling platform for many languages. I would also recommend you to use this platform as some compilers do not support some libraries and pointers I have used in this code. 

This calculator asks you to enter the number of expressions you need to calculate at first ,then allows you to perform all arithmetic operations {including squares and square root} , powers and exponential calculations. 
It also supports negative values and the limit of data size is dependent on the data type.
